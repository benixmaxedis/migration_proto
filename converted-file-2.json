  "data_quality": "After analyzing the provided phone system data, here are my findings and recommendations:\n\n1. **Missing or Invalid Phone Numbers**:\n   - All phone numbers are present and in a valid E.164 format (e.g., +15551234567).\n\n2. **Incomplete User Information**:\n   - All user records have a friendly name, email, and phone number present.\n\n3. **Data Inconsistencies**:\n   - No obvious data inconsistencies were found.\n\n4. **Potential Duplicate Accounts**:\n   - Based on the provided data, there are no duplicate account SIDs (account_sid), which are typically unique identifiers for each account. However, it's possible that duplicate accounts could exist if other unique identifiers (like email or phone number) are shared across accounts.\n\n5. **Format Issues**:\n   - The data is in a valid JSON format, which should not cause any migration issues.\n\n**Recommendations for Data Cleanup:**\n\n1. **Verify Unique Account Identifiers**: While the account SIDs appear unique, it's recommended to cross-check email addresses and phone numbers to ensure there are no duplicates. Duplicate accounts should be identified and merged or removed as appropriate.\n\n2. **Validate Email Addresses**: Although the email addresses appear correctly formatted, it's advisable to validate them against a list of valid email domains or patterns to ensure their authenticity.\n\n3. **Check for Inactive Accounts**: One account (Bob Wilson) is marked as \"inactive\". It's crucial to determine whether inactive accounts should be migrated or archived based on your business requirements.\n\n4. **Normalize Data Formats**: While the data appears well-formatted, it's recommended to standardize the casing of names (e.g., all uppercase, all lowercase, or proper case) and email addresses (typically lowercase) to ensure consistency across the system.\n\n5. **Consider Additional Data Validation**: Depending on your specific requirements, you may want to perform additional validation checks, such as verifying the association between phone numbers and account SIDs, or checking for any missing or invalid data in other fields not provided in the sample data.\n\nOverall, the provided data appears to be in a reasonable state for migration, but it's recommended to perform the suggested data cleanup steps to ensure a smooth and accurate migration process.",

    "reasoning": "The migration plan prioritizes active users to minimize disruption to ongoing business operations. Inactive users are migrated last as they have lower criticality. The migration is planned in batches to allow for rollback if needed. No dependencies between users have been identified.",
    "risk_assessment": "The overall risk level is low as the migration involves a straightforward account transfer. However, potential risks include data corruption, service outages, and user confusion. Mitigation strategies include thorough testing, clear communication with users, and contingency plans for rollback or manual intervention if issues arise during the migration process."
